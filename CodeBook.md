##File run_analysis.R

*This file is used for getting a tidy set as an end product for the Samsung dataset
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	+ For executing this step the dataset were read in a variable and then combined using rbind().
	+ The Y-Data X-Data and Subject Data were combined using cbind()
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	+ For this step we looked for the columns that have mean and std in their column name by using the grep function of R. We also extracted the columns named subjectID and activityLabel.
	+ After finding the columns we extracted out the dataset required in the result.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set & Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	+ For this step we used the activity_labels.txt files to learn about activity names and then we used factor function to put up descriptive activity names.
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	+ To create final dataset we used ddply function to find mean on each activityid and subject.
